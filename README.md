# NTI-Final-Assignment

### NTI-Final-Assignment Use flask(python)  and shiny dashboard (R) to build simple user interface to see how choosing classification model may affect prediction accuracy, using Customer Churn Dataset.

#### I tried to handle imbalanced classes in dataset using OverSampling technique (SMOTE Algorithm, RandomOverSampler) from imbalanced-learn API

##### Customer Churn probability (Yes / No).

## i have used: 
- Logistic Regression.
- KNN. 
- SVM.  
- Random forest. 
- Decision Tree. 
- Naive Bayes.
